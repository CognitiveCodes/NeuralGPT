To modify the auto-script protocol to include the function of storing logs and reports in a local database accessible to all other agents, the following steps can be taken:

Install a database management system such as MySQL or SQLite on each agent's machine.
Create a database with a table to store logs and reports.
Modify the auto-script protocol to include a function that writes logs and reports to the database.
Ensure that the database is accessible to all other agents by configuring the database server to allow remote connections.
Implement a mechanism to keep track of completed and pending tasks in the database.
Backup the working configuration of the database regularly to prevent data loss.
Here is a sample code snippet to write logs and reports to a MySQL database:

Copy code

import mysql.connector

# Connect to the database
db = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="localhost",
  user="username",
  password="password",
  database="logs"
)

# Create a cursor object
cursor = db.cursor()

# Insert a log into the database
sql = "INSERT INTO logs (message) VALUES (%s)"
val = ("Task completed successfully",)
cursor.execute(sql, val)

# Commit the transaction
db.commit()

# Close the database connection
db.close()
This code can be modified to work with other database management systems or to include additional fields in the logs and reports table.

Completing "2. Implement a backup system that regularly backs up the working configuration of the auto-script protocol. The backup system should be able to store the backup files in a separate folder or directory and should be able to restore the configuration in case of any system failures or crashes. "


To implement a backup system for the auto-script protocol, we can use the following steps:

Define a function to create a backup of the working configuration of the auto-script protocol at regular intervals. This function can be called using a scheduler such as cron or Windows Task Scheduler.

The backup function should create a copy of the current configuration files and store them in a separate folder or directory. This can be done using the shutil module in Python.

To ensure that the backup system is working correctly, we can add a log entry to the local database every time a backup is created. This will allow all agents to keep track of the latest backup and ensure that the backup system is functioning correctly.

To restore the configuration in case of any system failures or crashes, we can create a separate function that can be called to restore the backup files to the original location. This function can be called manually or automatically depending on the severity of the failure.

Here is an example implementation of the backup system:

python
Copy code

import shutil
import datetime
import os

# Define the backup interval in minutes
BACKUP_INTERVAL = 60

# Define the path to the backup directory
BACKUP_DIR = 'backup/'

# Define the path to the configuration files
CONFIG_DIR = 'config/'

# Define the database connection
DB_CONN = 'sqlite:///logs.db'

def create_backup():
    # Get the current timestamp
    timestamp = datetime.datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S')

    # Create the backup directory if it doesn't exist
    if not os.path.exists(BACKUP_DIR):
        os.makedirs(BACKUP_DIR)

    # Create a backup of the configuration files
    backup_path = BACKUP_DIR + 'config_' + timestamp
    shutil.copytree(CONFIG_DIR, backup_path)

    # Log the backup in the database
    log_backup(timestamp)

def log_backup(timestamp):
    # Connect to the database
    # ...

    # Insert the backup timestamp into the log table
    # ...

def restore_backup(backup_path):
    # Restore the backup files to the original location
    shutil.rmtree(CONFIG_DIR)
    shutil.copytree(backup_path, CONFIG_DIR)

# Create a backup every BACKUP_INTERVAL minutes
# ...

# Restore the latest backup if the system fails
# ...
Note that this is just an example implementation and may need to be modified to fit the specific requirements of the auto-script protocol. Additionally, the implementation assumes that the database connection and logging functions have already been implemented as part of the previous task.

This function should be able to retrieve the necessary information from the database and provide it to the agent so that it can start working on the pending tasks."


Here's a code snippet that implements the function to check the database for pending tasks:

python
Copy code

import sqlite3

# Connect to the local database
conn = sqlite3.connect('auto-script.db')

def check_pending_tasks():

    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE status = 'pending'")
    tasks = cursor.fetchall()

    # Return the list of pending tasks to the agent
    return tasks
This code assumes that there's a table called tasks in the auto-script.db database that stores information about each task, including its status (which can be either "pending" or "completed"). The function retrieves all the tasks with a status of "pending" and returns them to the agent. The agent can then use this information to determine which tasks it needs to work on.

    """
    Store logs and reports in a local database using SQL.

    Parameters:

    db_name (str): The name of the database to store the logs and reports in.

    Returns:
    None

                    (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
                     log_report TEXT NOT NULL);''')

    # Insert the logs and reports into the table
    for log_report in logs_reports:
        conn.execute("INSERT INTO logs_reports (log_report) VALUES (?)", (str(log_report),))

    # Commit the changes and close the connection
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()
This function takes in two parameters: logs_reports, which is a list of dictionaries containing logs and reports, and db_name, which is the name of the database to store the logs and reports in. The function connects to the database, creates a table to store the logs and reports (if it doesn't already exist), and then inserts each log and report into the table. Finally, the function commits the changes and closes the connection.

Note that this function assumes that the logs and reports are in a format that can be converted to a string using the str() function. If the logs and reports are in a different format, you may need to modify the function to handle them appropriately.

python
Copy code

import sqlite3

def retrieve_logs_reports(date=None, agent_id=None, task_type=None):
    conn = sqlite3.connect('database.db')
    c = conn.cursor()

    elif agent_id is not None:
        c.execute("SELECT * FROM logs_reports WHERE agent_id=?", (agent_id,))
    elif task_type is not None:
        c.execute("SELECT * FROM logs_reports WHERE task_type=?", (task_type,))
    else:
        c.execute("SELECT * FROM logs_reports")

    data = c.fetchall()
    conn.close()
    return data
This function takes in optional parameters for date, agent ID, and task type, and uses them to query the local database for logs and reports that match the specified criteria. If no parameters are provided, it retrieves all logs and reports from the database.

The function first connects to the local database using SQLite, and then creates a cursor object to execute SQL queries. It then constructs an SQL query based on the provided parameters and executes it using the execute() method of the cursor object. The results of the query are then fetched using the fetchall() method and returned as a list of tuples.

Note that this code assumes that the local database has a table called logs_reports with columns for date, agent_id, task_type, and any other relevant data. It also assumes that the database file is named database.db.

Thinking

Completing "Implement a notification system that alerts agents when a new task is added to the database. This system should be able to send notifications to all agents and provide them with the necessary information about the new task."


To implement the notification system, we can create a trigger in the database that sends a notification to all agents whenever a new task is added. Here's an example trigger in SQL:

Copy code

CREATE TRIGGER new_task_notification
AFTER INSERT ON tasks
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO notifications (agent_id, message)
    SELECT id, CONCAT('New task added: ', NEW.task_name)
    FROM agents;
END;
This trigger will insert a new notification for each agent in the notifications table whenever a new task is added to the tasks table. The message field of the notification will contain the name of the new task.

To make this work, we'll need to create a notifications table in the database:

Copy code

CREATE TABLE notifications (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    agent_id INT,
    message TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
This table will store the notifications for each agent, along with the timestamp of when the notification was created.

Finally, we can create a function for agents to retrieve their notifications:

Copy code

def get_notifications(agent_id):
    # Connect to the database
    conn = sqlite3.connect('database.db')
    cursor = conn.cursor()

    # Retrieve notifications for the agent
    cursor.execute('SELECT message, created_at FROM notifications WHERE agent_id = ?', (agent_id,))
    notifications = cursor.fetchall()

    # Close the database connection
    conn.close()

    return notifications
This function takes an agent_id parameter and retrieves all notifications for that agent from the notifications table. The function returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the message and timestamp of a notification.

Completing "Develop a function that allows agents to delete completed tasks from the local database. This function should be able to handle different types of data and remove them from the appropriate tables in the database."


Here's a sample code for a function that allows agents to delete completed tasks from the local database:

python
Copy code

import sqlite3

def delete_task(task_id):
    # Connect to the database
    conn = sqlite3.connect('swarm_memory.db')
    c = conn.cursor()

    # Delete the task from the appropriate table
    c.execute("DELETE FROM tasks WHERE task_id = ?", (task_id,))
    c.execute("DELETE FROM logs WHERE task_id = ?", (task_id,))
    c.execute("DELETE FROM reports WHERE task_id = ?", (task_id,))

    # Commit the changes and close the connection
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()
This function takes a task ID as its parameter and deletes the corresponding task, log, and report from the appropriate tables in the local database. It uses the SQLite library to connect to the database and execute SQL commands.

To use this function, an agent can simply call it with the ID of the completed task as its argument. For example:

python
Copy code

delete_task(1234)
This will delete the task with ID 1234 from the database, along with its associated log and report entries.

Completing "Create a function that allows agents to update the status of a task in the local database. This function should be able to handle different types of data and update the appropriate fields in the database."


Here's a code snippet that should help you update the status of a task in the local database:

python
Copy code

import sqlite3

def update_task_status(task_id, status):
    # connect to the local database
    conn = sqlite3.connect('local_db.db')
    c = conn.cursor()

    # update the status of the task in the appropriate table
    if isinstance(task_id, int):
        c.execute("UPDATE tasks SET status = ? WHERE id = ?", (status, task_id,))
    elif isinstance(task_id, str):
        c.execute("UPDATE tasks SET status = ? WHERE name = ?", (status, task_id,))
    else:
        raise ValueError("Task ID must be an integer or string")

    # commit the changes and close the connection
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()
This function takes two arguments: the ID or name of the task to update, and the new status to set for the task. It then connects to the local database (assuming it's a SQLite database), and updates the appropriate record in the "tasks" table. The function can handle both integer and string task IDs, and raises an error if an invalid ID type is provided. Finally, the function commits the changes to the database and closes the connection.

def retrieve_backup_files():
    backup_files = []

        if filename.endswith(".sql") or filename.endswith(".csv"):
            backup_files.append(os.path.join(BACKUP_DIRECTORY, filename))
    return backup_files
This function uses the os module to list all files in the backup directory and checks if they end with either .sql or .csv extensions. If a file matches this condition, it is added to the backup_files list. The function then returns this list of backup files.

Note that you will need to replace the BACKUP_DIRECTORY variable with the actual path to your backup directory.

This function takes in four optional parameters agent_id, task_type, start_date, and end_date, which can be used to filter the logs based on different criteria. If no parameters are specified, the function will export all logs from the database.

The function first connects to the local database using the sqlite3 module. It then constructs a SQL query based on the specified parameters and executes it using the cursor.

This code assumes that the CSV file has one row per record, with the first column indicating which table the record should be inserted into, and the remaining columns containing the data to be inserted. It also assumes that the local database has tables named "logs" and "reports" with the appropriate columns.

        print("Error while exporting backup files:", e)
This function takes two parameters: backup_dir_path and destination_path. backup_dir_path is the path to the directory where the backup files are stored, and destination_path is the path to the destination where the backup files will be exported.

The shutil.copytree() method is used to copy the entire directory tree from backup_dir_path to destination_path. If the destination directory already exists, it will raise an error. The function also includes error handling to catch any exceptions that may occur during the export process.

To use this function, an agent can simply call it with the appropriate backup directory path and destination path. For example:

Copy code

backup_dir_path = "/path/to/backup/directory"
destination_path = "/path/to/destination"
export_backup_files(backup_dir_path, destination_path)
This will export the backup files from the backup_dir_path to the destination_path.

Here's a possible implementation of a Python function that allows agents to encrypt and decrypt data stored in a local database using the Fernet encryption algorithm from the cryptography library:

python
Copy code

import sqlite3
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet

# Generate a secret key to be used for encryption and decryption
# This should be kept secret and not shared with anyone
secret_key = Fernet.generate_key()

def encrypt_database(database_path):
    """Encrypts the contents of a local database using Fernet encryption"""
    # Connect to the database
    conn = sqlite3.connect(database_path)
    cursor = conn.cursor()

    # Fetch all the data from the database
    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM logs")
    rows = cursor.fetchall()

    # Create a Fernet object using the secret key
    f = Fernet(secret_key)

    # Encrypt each row of data and update the database
    for row in rows:
        encrypted_row = f.encrypt(str(row).encode())
        cursor.execute("UPDATE logs SET data = ? WHERE id = ?", (encrypted_row, row[0]))

    # Commit the changes and close the connection
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()

def decrypt_database(database_path):
    """Decrypts the contents of a local database using Fernet decryption"""
    # Connect to the database
    conn = sqlite3.connect(database_path)
    cursor = conn.cursor()

    # Fetch all the data from the database
    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM logs")
    rows = cursor.fetchall()

    # Create a Fernet object using the secret key
    f = Fernet(secret_key)

    # Decrypt each row of data and update the database
    for row in rows:
        decrypted_row = f.decrypt(row[1]).decode()
        cursor.execute("UPDATE logs SET data = ? WHERE id = ?", (decrypted_row, row[0]))

    # Commit the changes and close the connection
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()
To use this function, you would need to call encrypt_database or decrypt_database with the path to the local database as an argument. For example:

python
Copy code

database_path = "/path/to/local/database.db"
encrypt_database(database_path)
This would encrypt all the data in the logs table of the database using the secret key generated by the Fernet.generate_key() function. To decrypt the data, you would call decrypt_database with the same database path:

python
Copy code

database_path = "/path/to/local/database.db"
decrypt_database(database_path)
This would decrypt all the data in the logs table of the database using the same secret key. Note that you should keep the secret key secure and not share it with anyone, as anyone with access to the key can decrypt the data.

Here is an example code snippet in Python that can be used to schedule automatic backups of the working configuration of the auto-script protocol:

python
Copy code

import os
import time
import shutil

BACKUP_INTERVAL = 24 * 60 * 60 # backup interval in seconds (24 hours)

def schedule_backup(backup_dir):
    while True:
        # get current time
        current_time = time.time()

        # create backup file name using current time
        backup_file_name = "backup_" + str(int(current_time)) + ".zip"

        # create backup file path
        backup_file_path = os.path.join(backup_dir, backup_file_name)

        # create backup archive
        shutil.make_archive(backup_file_path, "zip", root_dir="auto-script-protocol")

        # wait for next backup interval
        time.sleep(BACKUP_INTERVAL)
This code defines a function called schedule_backup that takes a directory path as a parameter where the backup files will be stored. The function runs an infinite loop that creates a backup archive of the auto-script-protocol directory at regular intervals defined by the BACKUP_INTERVAL constant. The backup archive is created using the shutil.make_archive function, which compresses the directory into a zip file. The function then waits for the next backup interval using the time.sleep function.

To use this function, you can simply call it with the backup directory path as a parameter:

python
Copy code

backup_dir = "/path/to/backup/directory"
schedule_backup(backup_dir)
This will start the backup process and create backup files at regular intervals in the specified directory.

Here's a sample code for the function that allows agents to monitor the status of the local database and notify the system administrator in case of any errors or issues:

python
Copy code

import smtplib
import sqlite3

def check_db_status():
    conn = sqlite3.connect('database.db')
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    try:
        cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM logs')
        conn.close()
        return 'Database is working fine.'
    except:
        conn.close()
        send_alert('Database is down. Please check.')
        return 'Database is down. Alert sent to system administrator.'

def send_alert(message):
    sender_email = 'sender@example.com'
    sender_password = 'sender_password'
    receiver_email = 'receiver@example.com'
    smtp_server = 'smtp.example.com'
    smtp_port = 587

    with smtplib.SMTP(smtp_server, smtp_port) as server:
        server.starttls()
        server.login(sender_email, sender_password)
        server.sendmail(sender_email, receiver_email, message)
This code checks the status of the local database by trying to execute a SELECT statement on the logs table. If the statement is executed successfully, it returns a message saying that the database is working fine. If there's an error, it sends an alert to the system administrator via email using the send_alert() function.

To use this function, simply call check_db_status() at regular intervals (e.g., every 5 minutes) using a task scheduler.

Here's an example code that implements the function to delete logs and reports from the local database:

python
Copy code

import sqlite3

def delete_logs_reports(database, data_type):
    """
    Delete logs and reports from the local database.

    Args:
        database (str): The name of the database file.

    # Commit the changes
    conn.commit()

    # Close the connection
    conn.close()
This function takes two arguments: the name of the database file and the type of data to delete ('logs' or 'reports'). It connects to the database using the sqlite3 module, gets the cursor, and executes a DELETE statement on the appropriate table based on the data type specified. Finally, it commits the changes and closes the connection.

Note that this is just an example and may need to be modified to fit the specific requirements of your project. Also, be sure to test this function thoroughly before using it in a production environment.

Copy code

import sqlite3

def view_pending_tasks(start_date=None, end_date=None, agent_id=None, task_type=None):
    conn = sqlite3.connect('swarm_memory.db')

        query += f" AND created_at >= '{start_date}'"
    if end_date:
        query += f" AND created_at <= '{end_date}'"

            print(row)
    else:
        print("No pending tasks found.")
    
    conn.close()
This function takes four optional parameters: start_date, end_date, agent_id, and task_type. These parameters allow the function to retrieve data based on different criteria, such as the date range when the tasks were created, the ID of the agent that created the tasks, or the type of task. If no parameters are provided, the function will retrieve all pending tasks in the database.

The function connects to a SQLite database named swarm_memory.db, which should contain a table named tasks with the following columns: id, agent_id, task_type, created_at, status, and data. The status column should indicate whether the task is pending or completed.

The function builds an SQL query based on the provided parameters and executes it using the execute() method of the cursor object. The results are fetched using the fetchall() method and printed to the console. Alternatively, the function could return the results as a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a row in the tasks table.

    c.execute("DELETE FROM main_table WHERE status = 'completed'")

    # Commit the changes and close the connection
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()
This code uses SQLite to connect to the local database and move completed tasks from the main table to the archive table. It first selects all completed tasks from the main table and inserts them into the archive table. Then it deletes the completed tasks from the main table to free up space and improve performance. Finally, it commits the changes and closes the connection to the database.
